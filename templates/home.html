                <span class="lead font-italic">Diving into Python has been a total rollercoaster! From figuring out the basics to tackling tricky algorithms, every bit of code feels like a puzzle piece in my coding adventure. So, here's the lowdown on my Python journey. I learned how to print Hello World, different types of data types which are integer, floating-point, string, Boolean, list, tuple, range, dictionary and none type. I also learn the different arithmetic operations, conditional statements, iterative processes which are the for, while and do while loop. Strings, numbers and how to manipulate them to use in a program. I was able to understand the differences and similarities between dictionaries, lists, and tuples. Create and manipulate dictionaries, lists, and tuples. Utilize dictionaries, lists, and tuples for data storage and retrieval. Use built-in methods and functions for dictionaries, lists, and tuples. I also learned how to understand the concept of modules and their role in code organization. Learn how to create and use modules. Learn how to define and call functions in Python. Apply functions to solve practical problems and improve code readability. Understand the concept of sets and arrays in Python. Learn how to create and manipulate sets and arrays. Further into the course understanding the concept of exceptions in Python and their significance in error handling is an essential lesson for me because it helps to code better and handle errors.  I learned how to use try-except blocks to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent program crashes, Use the else and finally clauses to execute specific code in different exception scenarios, I also learned how to read data from files using various methods, such as read(), readline(), and readlines().Grasp the concept of recursion and its use in solving complex problems through self-referential functions. Learn to implement recursion to traverse and manipulate complex data structures effectively. Finally at the end of the semester I learned how to use python for web development and how to use flask and how to implement CRUD functionality to the website. My journey into the Python jungle! Whether I was wrestling with bugs or high-fiving my screen after a breakthrough, every moment has been a wild ride.</span>

                <span class="lead font-italic">Throughout the semester, in this course, I primarily learned the fundamentals and some advanced concepts of using the python programming language. As a student who have spent the previous two semesters with php and dart programming language backed with Laravel and Flutter as framework for the respective languages, the simplicity by nature of Python is what helped me grasp through the program's ecosystem quite more effectively than the others.

                  Python has been on the top spot among the popular programming languages in the programming community, and undoubtedly, it is always highly associated with artificial intelligence and data analytics. But, what surprises me the most and surely not anticipated at all, is its capability to build web applications; that is just genuinely surprised me.
                
                  Among numerous topics I have learned with python, what I have really hoped I have done more for this subject is to exercise the concepts I have learned through activity or assignment. As someone who absolutely hate writing codes on leisure time, having an activity pushes me to pull myself together and utilize those times spent doing the activities to explore further on the programming concepts I haven't know yet. But despite that, I am still glad there is no huge loads of programming activities for this subject. Given that I am busy with my capstone project as leading the development of our system as the lead programmer, additional workload would only mean a big, big, trouble to me.
                
                  Overall, the semester of learning python was great. Along with the new concepts I have picked up through learning it, I am hoping it would serve as one of my assets in my future endeavor as an IT professional. After, adding python as one of the programming languages I know may help me land on to my future jobs more easily.</span>
